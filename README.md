- ### update.sh and view.sh

	Place them both in a directory. update.sh downloads, decrypt, and extract your tarball while view.sh lets you view your score at week XX. Use view.sh with arguments 00-11. **Don't forget to change the user in update.sh to your own username**. Example usage:

	bash update.sh
	
	bash view.sh 02
